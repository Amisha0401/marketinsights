<h1>Lactose-Free Milk Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Lactose-free milk is cow milk with added natural enzyme lactase, an enzyme that breaks down the milk-sugar lactose into more easily digestible sugars, glucose and galactose, so it?s easier to digest. Milk does have lactose, which is the naturally occurring sugar. The lactose in milk is hard to digest for some people (lactose intolerant), so adding the lactase enzyme breaks down the lactose into sugars making it more digestible for them. Therefore, since the lactose is converted to sugar, the term ?lactose free?.</p>
