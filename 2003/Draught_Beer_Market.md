 <p>Draught beer, also spelt draft, is beer served from a cask or keg rather than from a bottle or can. Draught beer served from a pressurised keg is also known as keg beer. Pressurized gas could be CO2, a mixture of Co2 and N2O, or air. The first two options being how most bars do it and it keeps the beer pretty fresh and carbonated until the keg is empty. The mixture of CO2 and N2O keeps the beer very fresh and also keeps the beer from absorbing too much CO2 and getting foamy.</p>
