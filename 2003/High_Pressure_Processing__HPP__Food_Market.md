<h1>High Pressure Processing (HPP) Food Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>High-Pressure Processing (HPP) is a cutting-edge USDA?approved all natural process that utilizes intense water pressure to protect against harmful bacteria without affecting a food product?s taste, texture, appearance or nutritional value.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Products are packaged, sealed and then placed in a cylinder-shaped pressure chamber where it is surrounded by water. Up to 87,000 pounds of water pressure?roughly equal to five to six times the pressure found at the bottom of the deepest ocean?are exerted per square inch, protecting against harmful bacteria and sealing in freshness and flavor naturally, with no preservatives needed.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>HPP is one of the latest technologies that utilize non-heat methods to preserve food. It has been studied by scientists for more than a hundred years, but only within the past 20 years have companies started applying HPP commercially.</p>
