**Report Overview**

Mixed-mode chromatography resin refers to the interactions or mixed-mode media used in this chromatographic method. Mixed-mode chromatography materials contain ligands of multimodal functionality that allow protein adsorption by a combination of ionic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and/or hydrophobic interactions. Complex mixtures like fermentation supernatants or cell lysates can be applied directly at relatively high conductivity, and elution is usually achieved by electrostatic charge repulsion.

**The global Mixed-Mode Chromatography Resin market size was estimated at USD 147 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 196.89 million by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 3.30% during the forecast period.**
