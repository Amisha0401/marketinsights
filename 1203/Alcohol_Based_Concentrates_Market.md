 <p>According to the recent past activities in various regions in the world, it can be concluded that consumption of alcohol or alcohol-based products has become an accompaniment for a number of reasons such as celebrations, commiserations, the end of the working day, and others. In many developed regions such as Europe, Canada, the U.S., alcohol is a socially accepted part of their daily life. Younger population of the world is influenced by their peer group or peer thinking, which is a factor driving the growth of the alcohol-based market. Changing lifestyles, an influence of social media and Internet, increasing social parties, adolescents with high social network influence, greater family incomes, and others have easier access to alcoholic drinks and alcoholic products, which is also driving demand for alcohol. Moreover, globally, the gender gap in terms of alcohol consumption is closing as there is increasing acceptance of female drinking in the societal norms. Because of all these factors, people are attracted towards alcohol and alcohol-based products, which is driving the growth of the alcohol-based flavor market and this is expected to continue over the forecast period. According to WHO, in 2005, the worldwide consumption of alcoholic beverages was around 6.13 liters of pure alcohol per person, who were above 15 years of age. The highest consumption level was mostly found in the Northern Hemisphere and also in the areas of Argentina, Australia, and New Zealand. There are various disadvantages and risks which can be caused by advertisements of alcohol-based products, publicly. There are foods, which contain the high volume of alcohol and if are exhibited publicly may cause harm to the image of the product. Consumers are looking towards clean-label products since the recent past and thus, if the alcohol-based products are advertised, consumers would not prefer it because of the adverse health effects of alcohol. Moreover, attracted to the advertisements, children may consume alcohol unintentionally while consuming the products. Due to this, the taste of alcohol can get familiarized among children. By consuming alcohol flavored products, children have the chance to get used to the taste of alcohol before they reach the legal drinking age. However, the alcohol in food is also hidden for recovering addicts.</p>
