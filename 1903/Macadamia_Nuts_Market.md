<h1>Macadamia Nuts Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Macadamia nuts are the fruit (edible seed) of the evergreen macadamia tree, which belongs to the genus Macadamia of the Proteaceae family. Only three of the species are of commercial importance, namely Macadamia integrifolia, Macadamia ternifolia, and Macadamia tetraphylla. Macadamias are native to Australia, but today, they are grown in many areas in the world. The largest producers of macademia nuts are Australia and South Africa, followed by Kenya, China, USA (Hawaii), Guatemala, Malawi, Vietnam, Colombia, New Zealand and Swaziland.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Once planted, the macadamia trees need five years before being able to carry their first fruit ? their maximum carrying capacity is reached after ten years. Macadamia trees require warm temperatures and good annual rainfall to yield a good crop. The biggest threats to annual production come from droughts and heavy frost.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The nuts themselves grow encased in a hard, woody shell, which is protected by a green-brown fibrous husk that splits open as the nut matures. Macadamia nuts are harvested mechanically or gathered from the ground in different periods throughout the entire year, depending on the country of origin. Because flowering occurs over several months, macadamia nuts mature and drop to the ground over an extended period, so they have to be harvested regularly. Due to long-term maturity, it is possible for flowering and harvesting to overlap. In the European winter months, they are harvested in Africa and Hawaii, while during the spring and summer months, harvesting occurs in Australia and Central and South America.</p>
