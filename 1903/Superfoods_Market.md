These foods often have an additional nutritional value (value-added products) in comparison to other food products such as a high fiber, antioxidant, mineral or vitamin content or a desirable fatty acid composition. Producers and marketers of superfoods highlight this extra value in order to market their products. Foods that are often discussed as being superfoods in the media include ancient grains, chia seeds, pulses, seaweed and kombucha.</p>
