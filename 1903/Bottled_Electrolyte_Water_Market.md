<h1>Bottled Electrolyte Water Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Electrolyzed water is a drink made by dissolving a group of compounds in water, which can supplement the consumption of human metabolism. It can quickly supplement the consumption of human body water and relieve fatigue quickly. Water and electrolytes are the building blocks of the basic substances that sustain life. The metabolic process of the human body is essentially a complex, interrelated process of biophysical and material chemical reactions, and it is mainly carried out in cells. These reactions are inseparable from water. The capacity, distribution and dissolution of water in the body, as well as the concentration of electrolytes in the water, are all controlled by the human body&#39;s regulating function, so that the capacity, electrolyte concentration, and osmotic pressure of intracellular and extracellular fluids can always be maintained within a certain range.</p>
