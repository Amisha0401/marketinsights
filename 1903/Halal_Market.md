<h1>Halal Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>The Arabic word for ?permitted.? Halal is commonly seen as ?Halal? which means food that is permitted under Islamic guidelines as found in the Qu?ran Most food and drinks are considered Halal unless they are clearly stated as forbidden in the Qur?an (holy book of Islam) and hadith (prophetic traditions).</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The halal industry is based on a belief that Muslims should eat food and use goods such as cosmetics that are "halalan toyibban", which means permissible and wholesome. In fact, the halal market is non-exclusive to Muslims, and has gained increasing acceptance among non- Muslim consumers who associate halal with ethical consumerism.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Actually, the halal industry has now expanded beyond the food sector to include pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, health products, toiletries and medical devices as well as service sector components such as logistics, marketing, print and electronic media, packaging, branding, and financing. In addition, the halal food marketplace is emerging as one of the most profitable and influential market arenas in the world food business today.</p>
