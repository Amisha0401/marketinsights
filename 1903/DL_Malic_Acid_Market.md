<h1>DL-Malic Acid Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Malic Acid, the natural acid constituent of apple, finds wide application in the food industry. Due to its compatibility with all types of flavour, the flavour enhancing property, the sharp, lingering acid taste and the high water solubility nature, it is ideally suited for the preparation of Juices, Soft drinks, Cider and Wines. DL-Malic acid is an organic compound with the molecular formula C4H6O5. It is a dicarboxylic acid that is made by all living organisms, contributes to the pleasantly sour taste of fruits, and is used as a food additive.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>DL Malic acid (2-hydroxy butanedioic acid) is manufactured through the hydration of Fumaric acid (trans-1, 2-ethylenedicarboxylic acid). A water molecule is added to each molecule of Fumaric acid. This is done under heat with high pressure. The duration of reaction determines the completeness of hydration.</p>
