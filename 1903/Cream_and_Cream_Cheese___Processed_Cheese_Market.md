<h1>Cream and Cream Cheese & Processed Cheese Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-butterfat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, will eventually rise to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called "separators". In many countries, cream is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. Cream can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets. Cream has high levels of saturated fat.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Cream cheese is a soft, mild-tasting fresh cheese with a high fat content. Stabilizers such as carob bean gum and carrageenan are typically added in industrial production.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Processed cheese (also known as prepared cheese, cheese product, plastic cheese, or cheese singles) is a food product made from cheese (and sometimes other, unfermented, dairy by-product ingredients); plus emulsifiers, saturated vegetable oils, extra salt, food colorings, whey or sugar. As a result, many flavors, colors, and textures of processed cheese exist.</p>

 <p>Processed cheese is made from its natural counterpart, with salt, whey, and emulsifiers added. An emulsifier is added to prevent the surface of the cheese from forming tiny pools of fat on the surface, which is a tendency in its natural counterpart. These emulsifiers may include sodium phosphate, tartrate, citrate, or potassium phosphate. It is also these emulsifiers that allow processed cheese to melt smoothly without clumping and prevent the oils from separating when heated. This is why processed alternatives are usually smoother, creamier, and preferred for sauces and cooking.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Popular types of natural cheeses include unripened (e. g., cottage cheese, cream cheese), soft (e. g, Brie, Camembert), semi-hard (e. g., Brick, Muenster, Roquefort, Stilton), hard (e. g., Colby, Cheddar), blueveined (e. g., Blue, Gorgonzola), cooked hard cheeses (e. g., Swiss, Parmesan), and pasta filata (stretchedcurd, e. g., Mozzarella, Provolone).</p>
