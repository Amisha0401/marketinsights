<h1>Sparkling Wine Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Sparkling wine is a type of wine with high carbon dioxide levels, which makes it fizzy. The bubbles result from natural fermentation that occurs either in the bottle or in a large tank.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The fermentation happens when sugar is added to wine, and yeast starts acting on the sugar, releasing carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide trapped inside a sealed space creates bubbles in the wine.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Many people refer to sparkling wine as Champagne. However, this term is exclusively reserved only for the sparkling wines made in the Champagne region of France.</p>
