 <p>One of the primary drivers for this market is the rapidly increasing price of cigarettes. The average consumer cannot buy cigarettes on a regular basis. As the price of cigarettes increases, the consumers will be compelled to resort to other products and this will increase the demand for tobacco alternative gums such as nicotine gums. Moreover, many countries are increasing the excise duties on cigarettes, which will further increase the price of cigarettes. For instance, in 2016, India increased the tobacco taxes for the fifth consecutive year. This increase in the cost of cigarettes will propel the growth of the global tobacco alternative gums market during the forecast period.</p>
