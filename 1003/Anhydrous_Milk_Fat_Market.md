 <p>Demand for AMF is increasing as an ingredient due to its high stability and longer shelf life. Anhydrous milk fat can be stored for several months at low temperature while at the same temperature butter turns putrid after some time and requires at least ?25?C temperature for storage. Unlike butter, AMF can be transported without refrigeration which increases its functionality and ease of use which is anticipated to drive the growth of anhydrous milk fat in developing regions, especially Asia-Pacific where there is lack of infrastructure over the supply chain and lack of proper storage facilities, which limits refrigerated products to major urban conglomeration. AMF finds its use as an ingredient in various products such as caramels, toffees, chocolate and imitation chocolate, fudges, flavors, recombined UHT milk, evaporated milk, ice cream, cheese and yogurt, soups & sauces, dairy spreads etc. as it is easy to mix and meter into other products which is expected to drive the growth of anhydrous milk fat over the forecast period.</p>
