 <p data-end="5504" data-start="5194"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong data-end="5219" data-start="5194">High Production Costs</strong>: Plant-based ingredients can sometimes be more expensive than traditional animal proteins, leading to higher production costs. These increased costs can be passed on to consumers, making plant-based pet foods less accessible for some pet owners, especially in price-sensitive markets.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p data-end="5826" data-start="5509"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong data-end="5545" data-start="5509">Lack of Regulation and Standards</strong>: The plant-based pet food market lacks comprehensive regulatory frameworks, and not all plant-based pet foods are guaranteed to meet the nutritional standards required by pets.
