<h1>Milk Kefir Grain Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030</h1><br/><p>Milk kefir grains produce a tart, sour-tasting drinking yoghurt. It contains the highest number of bacteria and yeasts found in any of our cultures. Most people do not enjoy drinking milk kefir. It is best to consider it as a medicinal product. It can be mixed with fruit, syrup, or made into a smoothie to mask the sour taste. Organic milk kefir grains produce a cultured, fermented milk drink, originally from the mountainous region that divides Asia and Europe. It is similar to yoghurt ? but a drink, with a tart, sour taste and a slight ?fizz?. This is due to carbon dioxide ? the end product of the fermentation process. The length of the fermentation time will affect the taste. Milk Kefir is a good source of calcium and is rich in bacteria. A vast variety of bacteria have been isolated and identified in kefir grains. Known species are among four genus groups; Lactobacilli, Streptococci Lactococci, Acetobacter and Yeasts. So far over 50 strains of bacteria and yeasts have been identified from milk kefir around the world, making it one of the best sources known. Our European milk kefir is known to contain over 20 strains of bacteria and yeast. A vast variety of bacteria have been isolated and identified in kefir grains.

The milk kefir grains also transform dairy sugars into a few other things, including lactic acid, CO2 and small amounts of alcohol. We have never noticed or felt any effects from the minimal amounts of alcohol produced in the fermented milk kefir. We thought it was worth mentioning though, if you?re sensitive to alcohol or been advised to avoid it altogether, it might be something to consider.</p>
