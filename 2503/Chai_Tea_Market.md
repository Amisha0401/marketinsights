<h1>Chai Tea Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030</h1><br/><p>Chai tea has its origins in India. The word ?chai? is a Hindi word that simply means tea. Before the British colonial rule, the traditional recipe of chai in India was an ayurvedic preparation (dating back to 5000 years ago) which was just a healing spice blend beverage. The British introduced tea plantations and the habit of drinking tea into India. Only after this did Chai come to include tea leaves, milk, sugar, and spices. The term chai has now become synonymous with a blend of whole spices steeped in a tea-like beverage. The main ingredients of today?s chai tea include tea, milk, a sweetener, and spices. Although the spices used vary between regions, the most commonly used ones are cardamom pods, fresh ginger roots, cloves, cinnamon, and black peppercorns.</p>
