<h1>Darjeeling Tea Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030</h1><br/><p>Darjeeling tea is a well-known tea variety that is exported around the world. It grows in the Darjeeling district of West Bengal, India. Darjeeling tea is unique because the leaves can be processed in different ways, resulting in black, green, white, or oolong tea. Darjeeling tea is made from the Chinese variety of the tea plant Camellia sinensis. It is a thin, light-colored tea with a floral aroma. The tea plant, like most plants, goes through periods of growth and periods of dormancy. Each flush is a period that starts when the tea plant grows new leaves and ends when those leaves are harvested. Darjeeling tea has three major flushes. The first flush takes place mid-March to May, the second flush is from June to mid-August, and the third flush (also known as autumn flush) occurs October to November.</p>
