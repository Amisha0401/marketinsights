<h1>Water Kefir Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030</h1><br/><p>Water kefir is an artisanal and ancient fermented beverage, fruity, acidic, sour, and slightly carbonated, with high lactic acid content(up to 2%) and low alcohol content(usually less than 1%), which is obtained after the fermentation of sugary water with water kefir grains (starters), to which dried fruits can be added.
